# Project MetaJS
metamachine - rewritten for the web!

## Features
- Generate playlist of 4 elements
- Autoplay all vidoes in loop via LifemirrorPlayer

## Bugs
- querymain.js: playlist contains duplicates
- LifemirrorPlayer.js: If a video comes twice in a row (duplicate), playlist will be stuck with current video
